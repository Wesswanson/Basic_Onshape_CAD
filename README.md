# Basic Onshape CAD
## These are basic designs I've built with Onshape:

#### Step 1: Building the base

I started a sketch on the top plane of a new document. I created a rectangle with the dimentions 200mm x 120mm. Then, I created a center-point circle 20mm away from both sides of the rectangle, with a diamiter of 10mm. I created a linear pattern with two other circles, each 80mm apart. then, I extended it downw to make two rows of three circles. I extruded the rectangle without the circles 8mm, and renamed it "fork hole".
