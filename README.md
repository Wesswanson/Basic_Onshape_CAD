## Step 1: Building the Base

### Description:

The first assignment is to create the caster base. I started a sketch on the top plane of a new document. I created a rectangle with the dimensions 200mm x 120mm. Then, I created a center-point circle 20mm away from both sides of the rectangle, with a diameter of 10mm. I created a linear pattern with two other circles, each 80mm apart. Then, I extended it downwards to make two rows of three circles. I extruded the rectangle without the circles 8mm. I added a hole on the orgin (60mm away from the short side and 60mm away from the long side) with a diamiter of 25mm.

### Evidence
This is what the base looks like in onshape.

### Reflection

[Watch this video for very detailed instructions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4) 

When I was building this asignment is was very helpful to know the keybord shortcuts inorder to build designs much faster. I used these skills when I built the base:

* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

[Watching this video has very detailed instructions that will help a lot if you are confused at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)

Remember:
* When creating a linear pattern (or other fetures like a mirror), make sure that "feture" is selected at the top instead of part if you want to create a pattern of a feture, such as the holes in the base.
* Rename all your parts and fetures to keep track of which ones are which. that will be very helpfull with complex designs.

## Step 1: Building the base



## Step 2: building the mount

I created a sketch on the face of the bace. I clicked "use fetures" and copied the outside of the base and the four small circles on the left, and the large circle. Than I used the trim feture to delete the side of the rectangle with the circles i didn't copy. I added a line to turn the rectangle into a square with dimentions 120mm x 120mm. I extruded my new sketch as a new part by 8mm, and renamed it "mount".
