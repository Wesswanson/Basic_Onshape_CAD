## step 1: Building the Base

### Description:

The first assignment is to create the caster base. I started a sketch on the top plane of a new document. I created a rectangle with the dimensions 200mm x 120mm. Then, I created a center-point circle 20mm away from both sides of the rectangle, with a diameter of 10mm. I created a linear pattern with two other circles, each 80mm apart. Then, I extended it downwards to make two rows of three circles. I extruded the rectangle without the circles 8mm. I added a hole on the orgin (60mm away from the short side and 60mm away from the long side) with a diamiter of 25mm.

### Evidence
This is what the base looks like in onshape.

### Reflection

When I was building this asignment is was very helpful to know the keybord shortcuts inorder to build designs much faster. I used these skills when I built the base:

* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

[Watching this video has very detailed instructions that will help a lot if you are confused at all!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)

Remember:
* When creating a linear pattern (or other fetures like a mirror), make sure that "feture" is selected at the top instead of part if you want to create a pattern of a feture, such as the holes in the base.
* Rename all your parts and fetures to keep track of which ones are which. that will be very helpfull with complex designs.

## Step 2: Building the Mount

### Description

The second step in building a caster is building a mount. I created a sketch on the face of the bace I built in the first asignment. I clicked the "use fetures" tool and selected the outside of the base and the four small circles on the left side and the large circle. Than I used the trim feture to delete the right side of the rectangle. I added a line to turn the rectangle into a square with the dimentions 120mm x 120mm. I extruded my new sketch as a new part by 8mm, and renamed it "mount".

### Reflection

It was very easy and fast to coppy the design I had built in the base and use it for the mount. you can build it seperatly in it's own part studio or document, it just takes more time to build it from scratch.

[Watch this video for three ways to do this asignment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWDk4BZFXDQ&feature=emb_logo)

Remember:
* if you build the mount in the same part studio as the base, make it it's own part when you extrude it.
* if you build the mount in it's own part studio, use all the keybord shortcuts above.

On this asignment I learnded how to use the trim feture (looks like scisors) and the copy feture. 

Designing stuff on Onshape is really fun!!!
