### Building A Caster on Onshape


#### Step 1: Building the base

I started a sketch on the top plane of a new document. I created a rectangle with the dimensions 200mm x 120mm. Then, I created a center-point circle 20mm away from both sides of the rectangle, with a diameter of 10mm. I created a linear pattern with two other circles, each 80mm apart. Then, I extended it downwards
to make two rows of three circles. I extruded the rectangle without the circles 8mm. I added a hole on the orgin (60mm away from the short side and 60mm away from the long side) with a diamiter of 25mm.


#### Step 2: building the mount

I created a sketch on the face of the bace. I clicked "use fetures" and copied the outside of the base and the four small circles on the left, and the large circle. Than I used the trim feture to delete the side of the rectangle with the circles i didn't copy. I added a line to turn the rectangle into a square with dimentions 120mm x 120mm. I extruded my new sketch as a new part by 8mm, and renamed it "mount".
